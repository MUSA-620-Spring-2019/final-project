# Final Project

The final project is to replicate the pipeline approach on a dataset (or
datasets) of your choosing.

The final deliverable will be a web-based data visualization
and accompanying description including a summary of the results and the methods
used in each step of the process (collection, storage, analysis and
visualization).

Written proposal due date: **Wednesday, April 24th**
